**TODO**
- Restyle page to match the mood, more polish, animations, etc - new layout? [loading animation while in progress, can't resize the window (no scrollbar, etc)]
- Click on song to play it via spotify or something
- Change/update mood selections, improve prompts etc (pics are kind of wierd)
- Do something more around genres and similar artists (type in band name) rather than mood (ie. shpongle and related, or progressive breakbeats)
